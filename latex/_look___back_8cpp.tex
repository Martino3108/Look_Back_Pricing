\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of Monte Carlo pricing and finite-\/difference Greeks for lookback options. 

The pricing method uses Open\+MP to parallelize Monte Carlo draws. Each thread uses its own RNG instance seeded deterministically from the thread id to prevent data races.

Numerical notes:\+
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Antithetic variates are used (plus/\+minus Z).
\item Uniform draws are clamped to avoid log(0).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
Some Greeks infer the Monte Carlo sample size as N = 1/\+h\texorpdfstring{$^\wedge$}{\string^}4, which can become huge. 
\end{DoxyWarning}
